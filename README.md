## ðŸŒŸ EcoClimateGlobal

A hugo powered static website for EcoClimateGlobal

### Maintainers

- [Dave Klinges](https://github.com/dklinges9)

## Navigation / Important Directories and Files

_Edit the Menu_: config/_default/menus.en.toml  
\_Edit Site Pages_: most pages are stored in content/english  
_Documents_: content/english/docs/ Having a docs/ folder in the root no longer works for hyperlinking  
_Images_: assets/images/ (**NOT** the root images/ dir. That's a derived property)  
_Contact page_: configs/\_default/params.toml

### Contributing Your Changes

Push changes directly to:  
https://github.com/dklinges9/ecoclimateglobal/

A few minutes after pushing changes to remote, the website should be automatically re-deployed with the new updates (if your commit didn't break anything!)

## Testing / Local Deployment

### Development Command

Start the development server using the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Running this command should then generate a local address by which to view the development version of the website. This address will take the following form: [http://localhost:1313/](http://localhost:1313/)

### Preview Command

Start the production server to preview your changes and test functionality:

```bash
npm run preview
```

### Build Command

Build the project for production, generating optimized static files:

```bash
npm run build
```

### Format Command

Format HTML and .md file:

```bash
npm run format
```

_Upon formating HTML per above command, You may receive a series of errors having to do with these modules:_  
node_modules/prettier  
node_modules/prettier-plugin-go-template

As of 10 November 2024, these errors do not seem to impact performance.

## Modifying CSS Templates

Annoyingly, lots of this website relies upon what is coded within templates, and so you can't modify too many things (eg font sizes, images sizes) directly in the \_index.md files. Instead, you need to modify or add CSS classes.

If you want to modify the CSS classes (e.g. change a default text size as part of the template for a given page, such as the _services_ template that renders your Research page), you will need to do so in the following directory:

[themes/airspace-hugo/assets/scss/](themes/airspace-hugo/assets/scss/)

For instance, if you want to make a new class for modifying an image size, you will need to add the class here:

[themes/airspace-hugo/assets/scss/templates/\_images.scss](themes/airspace-hugo/assets/scss/templates/_images.scss)

You may not need to for displaying the preview, but it is safe to re-build and format the website before these changes will take place (see the [Build Command](#build-command) and [Format Command](#format-commmand) above)

Upon re-building, you can confirm that the new/modified CSS class was in the new build by checking if it exists in this file:

[resources/\_gen/assets/scss/style.scss_d9077b5cab49df084fb1a39ad4b1e75d.content](resources/_gen/assets/scss/style.scss_d9077b5cab49df084fb1a39ad4b1e75d.content)

**DO SO WITH CAUTION.**

Modifying the [css/style.css](css/style.css) file will make no changes, as this is a derived file.
