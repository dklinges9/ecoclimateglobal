  title : "Linking Thermal Ecology and Biogeography for understanding Global Change"
  content : "
<br>
<br>

The ecological disciplines of spatial ecology, macroecology and biogeography have made considerable developments in recent decades, yet largely independent of the equally important fields of ecophysiology and biophysics. My research program seeks to unify these fields for a more integrative and nuanced understanding of how biodiversity, environments and societies respond to global change.

<br>
<br>

<strong>_How will ecological systems and landscapes change in the face of the compounded threats of land use change and climate change?_

      content : "Most climate change research relies on weather stations placed in flat, open locations. Yet climate warming and variability impact humans, crops, and biodiversity locally through microclimates generated by vegetation, topography, buildings, and other features. Core to my research is defining ecologically-relevant microclimate, and exploring the importance of microclimates for ecology and conservation through observation and modeling.

      content : "Studying biodiverse settings such as the tropics is paramount. Yet all too often Westerners temporarily visit Majority World nations with good intentions only to extract insights without thorough engagement with local stakeholders. To combat such helicopter science, we seek to learn from our collaborators in Madagascar to center their perspectives and goals. Such partnerships have so far culminated in capacity-building workshops (e.g. data analysis for staff of Madagascar National Parks) and knowledge co-production through ecological research.

      icon : "ion-earth"
      color : "primary-darker"

      content : "Climate change and habitat loss pose colossal challenges to biodiversity. One way a species can adapt to changing conditions is by migrating to track tolerable climates and habitats. Critical for conservation and restoration, therefore, is to identify if, where, and why species will move in response to global change. Yet our abilities to predict species' shifting distributions remain lackluster. I attempt to improve our forecasts of species' distributions, integrating big data on animal occurrences and remote sensing with mathematical models that represent biophysiology, demography, and dispersal.

      content : "Animal physiology is a junction of an individual's traits and behavior with its environment. I integrate experimentally-derived measurements of physiological responses to climate with tools and theory on landscape ecology. I focus upon the physiology of amphibians, which are functionally diverse, and also the most threatened vertebrate clade globally. Given that amphibians are ectothermic (i.e. no external source of heat, or 'cold-blooded') they are highly sensitive to their local climatic conditions. This makes them an ideal group of organisms for thermal ecology and microclimate studies.

      content : "While the biodiversity of forests is generally recognized, scientists focus our attention on the ground, neglecting the immense biological richness of understories and canopies (~80% of tropical forest species found aboveground). I explore how the underappreciated biogeographic axis of vertitude – from forest floor to canopy – shapes the thermal niches, morphology, and dispersal abilities of animals.
