# Joining the EcoClimate Lab Group

<br>

Please see below for current and upcoming opportunities to join the group. We always welcome inquiries from motivated potential members with research interests that fit our group!


We prioritize new members who will facilitate the largest amount of growth for the group – you learn more from us, and we learn more from you. This entails membership from a diverse set of backgrounds, perspective, disciplines, and skillsets. Ideally, you can (or soon will) do things that we cannot, and we can do things that at first were new to you, so that we are all growing together. Ultimately, however, we are unified by our research interests and mission: advancing knowledge and practice on how humans, crops, and biodiversity is impacted by climate change.

### Postdoctoral Associate - Rutgers University

We will be hiring a **Postdoctoral Associate for a two-year contract beginning Fall 2026**. The chosen individual will conduct research related to one or more of a range of options pertinent to existing projects and databases developed within EcoClimate, and/or merged with their own interests and background. Possible projects include:

-- Analyzing rates of climate change and extreme events as experienced by life on earth using in-house databases (e.g. DirtClim) and open-source mechanistic microclimate models  

-- Using process-based models to estimate ongoing and future range shifts of socially and economically important species

-- Iterative near-term forecasting of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems with an emphasis on microclimate and ecophysiology

-- Developing novely mechanistic approaches to pair theory from physiology, landscape ecology, and behavioral ecology

### Fully-funded PhD Student – Rutgers University 

We will be recruting a **PhD student to join the lab beginning Fall 2026, with five years of support**. The student will be eligible to enter Rutgers Doctoral programs in [Ecology and Evolution](https://deenr.rutgers.edu/graduate/ecology-evolution-graduate-program), [Atmospheric Science](https://grad.rutgers.edu/academics/programs/atmospheric-science), or [Enviromental Sciences](https://envsci.rutgers.edu/academics/envsci_grad/). 

If interested, please reach out to Dave Klinges ([dklinges9@gmail.com](mailto:dklinges9@gmail.com)) to discuss your application. In your email, please include  your CV / resume, unofficial transcripts, and a brief description of your research interests and how they fit into our lab.

<br>
<br>

### Undegraduate Students – Rutgers University

We will be open to accepting one or several undergraduate students during the academic semesters and summer to work with us on our ongoing research projects, and develop independent projects related to research in the lab. At present, we will only have opportunities for undergraduates to get involved in compuational projects, rather than field or lab-based projects.

<br>

If interested, please reach out to Dave Klinges ([dklinges9@gmail.com](mailto:dklinges9@gmail.com)). In your email, please include  your CV / resume, unofficial transcripts, and a brief description of why you are interested in getting involved with our group.

<br>
<br>

### Remote Lab Members

We are open to collaborating through other means even without formal involvement at Rutgers. Please reach out to Dave Klinges ([dklinges9@gmail.com](mailto:dklinges9@gmail.com)) if you are interested in leading research projects that pertain to the group's interests.
